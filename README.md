### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)
The intent What's Cookin? Pt 2 was to continue functionality of a recipe webpage. Whereas the first iteration of the webpage filtered local recipe data and displayed them onto interactive recipe cards, the current iteration works with API Fetch requets. Here, not only does recipe data come from API requests, but also user data is randomly generated through the server. In addition, when a user chooses to "Save To Recipes", the data is stored using a POST method storing the data using API requests.

### Installation Instructions:
[//]: <> (What steps does a person have to take to get your app cloned down and running?)
1) Access the form here: https://github.com/Swatzell/whats-cookin
2) Copy the SSH repository URL git@github.com:Swatzell/whats-cookin.git
3) Open terminal and 'cd' into the directory you wish to clone 
4) Clone the repository by submitting `git clone git@github.com:Swatzell/whats-cookin.git`

### Preview of App:
[//]: <> (Provide ONE gif or screenshot of your application - choose the "coolest" piece of functionality to show off.)

### Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)
This second portion of the project was given one week of time, assigned on Tuesday April 9 and due on Monday April 15. The three participants are all into the second 6-week "module" of four.

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)
The learning goals of this portion of the project was to demonstrate ability with API requests, namely GET and POST methods for retreiving and storing data. We used the tech of JS, HTML, CSS, and Webpack. 

### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)
1) We learned how to successfully link a local server with the API, and successfully use POST requests for saving recipes and GET methods for retrieving the data.
2) We learned how to sharpen our communication and time management by successfully using the Project Board and creating actionable issues to be resolved within pull requests. 
3) We learned how to dynamically integrate CSS with HTML that is not set globally, but rather created upon user events.
